# ADF-50: Alert Classifier Test Cases

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive test cases for the Alert Classification system, implementing test-driven development for the intelligent alert management components.

## Test Categories

### GADF-ALERT-001a: Severity Calculation Tests
- Threshold-based severity calculation
- Deviation percentage to severity mapping
- Business impact factor integration
- Historical context consideration

### GADF-ALERT-001b: Business Impact Scoring Tests
- Metric importance weighting
- Stakeholder impact assessment
- Downstream system dependencies
- Time-of-day impact adjustments

### GADF-ALERT-001c: Multi-Factor Classification Tests
- Combined severity factors
- Weighted classification algorithms
- Context-aware adjustments
- Classification confidence scoring

### GADF-ALERT-001d: Classification Consistency Tests
- Deterministic classification behavior
- Consistent results across similar inputs
- Classification stability over time
- Edge case handling consistency

## Test Structure

Following TDD principles with comprehensive test coverage:

- **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing
- **Integration Tests**: Component interaction testing
- **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions and error scenarios
- **Performance Tests**: High-volume alert processing validation

## Test Data

Test fixtures include:
- Sample alert data for all severity levels
- Mock detection results
- Configuration test data
- Performance test scenarios

## Implementation Notes

Tests are written before implementation to ensure:
1. Clear requirements definition
2. Comprehensive edge case coverage
3. Performance validation
4. Consistent behavior verification
