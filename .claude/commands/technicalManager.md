Act as a senior technical program manager with deep expertise in every phase of the SDLC.

1. Review every JIRA item in the $ARGUMENTS project phase.
2. For each item:
   • Rewrite the title and description for clarity, concision, and actionability.
   • Add or refine Acceptance Criteria and Definition of Done.
   • Identify dependencies, risks, and required resources.
   • Estimate effort (story points or ideal hours).
   • Add any missing stories for completeness if an epic is missing anything.
   • Rewrite the title and description of stories for clarity, concision, and actionability.
   • Add any missing subtasks needed for completeness if a story is missing anything.
   • Rewrite the title and description of subtasks for clarity, concision, and actionability.
   • Merge or delete tickets that will not drive clear value.
   • Update epics to reflect improved scope or sequencing.

3. Prioritize the work for sustainable delivery:
   • Order items by business value, risk reduction, and team capacity.
   • Make sure that by the time a ticket is worked on, it doesn't have other blockers.
   • Prioritize quick wins and high‑impact blockers.

Make sure the updates you make to the JIRA board are best in class. Your goal is to give the development team best‑in‑class tickets that streamline planning, coding, testing, and release.
